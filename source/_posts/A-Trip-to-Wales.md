So after months of 'dropping hints' (moaning) that I may need a new bike, it came a point when getting my forks serviced, and loco tuning said they where beyond repair. I new it was time!

My fiance agreed, the hints had worked, that I needed a new bike, so with an imminent wales tripped booked I got online quick.
It had to be a one bike to rule them all, and I had been toying with the idea of getting a smaller suspension more pedal oriented bike, but with the wales trip booked that was clouding my judgment and full smashy bike it had to be.

It was now Wednesday and I was going on the Friday, I managed to order a reign 2 to be collected in wales on the Saturday morning, all built and ready to ride.

The few days wait took ages, I couldn't wait to get out on my new bike, for this reason, the waiting, I hate internet shopping, everything else, like keeping me in a job, it's awesome.

We drove up Friday straight from work, the weather looked good...
As we got into wales in the dark it started to rain, a lot. I was camping.
As we arrived it was still drizzling with the look of more rain to come, I quickly pitched my tent under the lights of the van, happy that I had a super awesome technical tent, and even forked out on a self inflating sleeping mat, I was ready for a good sleep.
How wrong I was.

Turns out I hadn't used the tent for a few years, and although I checked it was still in one piece and no missing poles, I did not check check wether it kept water on the outside still, nor did I check that my super awesome sleeping bag would actually keep me warm, so I spent a night cold, damp and trying to stay on my mat, ie the dry parts of the inside of my tent.

Morning couldn't come quick enough. Whilst eating our breakfast we looked up, and there it was snow. nothing settling at our camp, but the hills where all white capped, as I drove out to swansea I could see snow capping all the hills where I would shortly be, it was at this point I thought it would probably be best to pick up another tent, or some proofer to sort it out slightly.

Collecting the bike was fairly none eventful, waiting waiting, can I ride it yet! We set up all the sag and tweaked things best we could for initial riding. then back to Afan to ride.

My first impressions so awesome, this thing pulls up hills and shreds down them. I was sure I was leaving Paul on the climbs and the descents, we are usually pretty well matched, pushing each other.

As we cruised up the switchbacks we neared the fun part, I was eager to point this thing down the hill as soon as I could, and when I did it didn't disappoint. 
Dropping into a nice boldery section the reign took everything in its stride I could feel the only thing holding it back was me, apart from it was struggling to keep grip, upon inspection in my haste I'd forgotten to check the tyre pressures, 50psi the shop had given me may have be a little much.

The hole descent was ear to ear grins, the new reign just wanted to be pushed and felt so much fun.
