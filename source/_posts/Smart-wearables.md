I remember the arrival of smart watches and how pointless they were in my mind. I now live by my smartwatch. It reminds me to put the bins out, when I have a meeting and it tells me when I've been stationary for to long.

I recently found how much I needed a smart watch when I found the garmin vivoactive. 
I do an amount of cycling, not a large amount but an amount, and tracking this is also something I found I need, but having to have my smart phone on me is annoying, but a necessity, or at least it was.

The vivoactive can't be much bigger than a Â£2 coin and has built in gps and motion sensors and the ability to link to many other sensors via ant+.

Having haptic feedback, to your wrist, to let you know you've travelled 5miles or you have a new message is definitely a great way of gently receiving information.

It's definitely not the best at everything, the developer options are no where near as good as the pebble, the os is still pretty new, and the arrival of third party apps quite new also, but it ticks all the boxes for me.

great functions I use

* track my steps and lets me know when inactive
* gps tracks my cycling/running/walking
* alarms and notifications from my smartphone

Ok so doesn't do a great deal, but it's amazing how much I miss it if I forget to put it on.

My main aim is to be able to ride my bike without a pack and still have everything I need on me, and this puts me one step closer and a bit more connected.
