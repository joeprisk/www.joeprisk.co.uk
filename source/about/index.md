### Some stuff about me

I am a ( software developer | web engineer | code monkey | computer voodoo creator ) with around 10 years experience of working on the web, I work for [Headforwards](https://www.headforwards.com) on large scale projects, and occasionally privately on small projects in my spare time to fund my bike obsession.

### Origins 

I started out as a content editor for a large ecommerce store. I taught myself html as a necessity, I am now a full stack developer and work with what ever works for our clients.

Main experience is focused around PHP with html + javascript front end, Also have experience with Ruby, server side javascript, tinkered with android & ios development. 

Been an avid linux enthusiast for years, more recently I have been pushed into osx world, which I'm still not entirely happy about.

I'm becoming more and more of a javascript fan the more I tinker, I've been using angularjs for around 4 years and small node apps in my personal time, also with the arrival of properly native js on mobile apps things are looking up and up for the language.

### Fun times

Apart from writing code I ride mountain bikes (badly) and enjoy playing outside.
